**Agent:**

> I understand that you need a two-hour session and that Thursday afternoon is your preferred time. However, my previous search for online investing sessions on Thursday afternoon (June 4th) for two hours returned no available slots. This means there are no two-hour sessions scheduled or available to be booked at that time through our system.
